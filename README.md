  ## Installation
  
 You can install a desktop version of this application by clicking on the install button in the top-left corner of the editor. I have experienced some difficulty with the install button in some browsers. If it doesn't work in your default browser, try using FireFox to complete the download. 
  
  ## Usage
  
  To use this application, you only need to navigate to the web version of the application. Once you are on the site you can start typing and using the text editor. Here is a screenshot of what you should see when you navigate to the site:
